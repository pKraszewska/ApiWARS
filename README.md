This is a small web application that shows data about the Star Wars universe.

## About the Project
This is the project created during my education in Codecool in second of four modules, focused on Web applications.

The goal was to:

1. Practice front-end skills:

    * JavaScript

    * AJAX

    * HTML/CSS

    * DOM manipulation

    * web design

2.Store data (Login and voting informations) in a local database (PostgreSQL)

3.Use Flask as a back-end

4.Fetch information about Star Wars from https://swapi.co API (This site provides an endpoint with no authentication needed)

5.Create a simple user login system with sessions

6.Create a voting system (User can vote for planets)
